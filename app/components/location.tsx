    rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvest Moon Pond</a>. It's about 20 minutes by car from Madison.
    We'll have a shuttle from the hotel to and from the venue, but we recommend renting a car if you're 
    staying somewhere else or think you might want to leave early.

    <p className="indent-8">Harvest Moon Pond is an old dairy farm that's been turned into a wedding venue.
    We picked it because we love the large willow trees, beautiful interior, and flexible spaces for the unpredictable Wisconsin weather.
