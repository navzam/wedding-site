<h2 className="text-2xl font-extrabold text-emerald-600">Our Story</h2>
<p className="indent-8">We both were studying abroad after our freshman year at OU through the Honors at Oxford program in Summer 2018. We briefly met before the trip and became fast friends throughout our month in the UK. We bonded over our shared tastes in music, books, and board games and quickly started dating in September of 2018!</p>
<p className="indent-8">After college, we packed up and moved across the country to Madison, WI in January 2022. Jack is working as a software developer at Epic Systems and Hannah is finishing her Masterâ€™s degree in environmental engineering in December. We absolutely love our life in Madison with our two cats, Pesto and Moka, and can't wait to start the next chapter!</p>
<p className="indent-8">Jack proposed to Hannah in November 2023. He said to get ready so that we could take fall photos in the Arboretum. As we were walking through the Arboretum, he proposed in the same area where we had our first date in Madison when Hannah was visiting him when he was an intern at Epic in Summer 2020!</p>
